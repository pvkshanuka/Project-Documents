**Client-side service discovery allows services to find and communicate with each other without hard-coding hostname and port**. The only â€˜fixed point' in such an architecture consists of a service registry with which each service has to register.

A drawback is that all clients must implement a certain logic to interact with this fixed point. This assumes an additional network round trip before the actual request.

With Netflix Eureka each client can simultaneously act as a server, to replicate its status to a connected peer. In other words, a client retrieves a list of all connected peers of a service registry and makes all further requests to any other services through a load-balancing algorithm.

To be informed about the presence of a client, they have to send a heartbeat signal to the registry.

To achieve the goal of this write-up, we'll implement three microservices:

- a service registry (**Eureka Server**),
- a REST service which registers itself at the registry (**Eureka Client**) and
- a web application, which is consuming the REST service as a registry-aware client (Spring Cloud Netflix **Feign Client**).
